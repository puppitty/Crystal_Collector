# Crystal Collector Game

When the user starts a New Game, each Crystal is assigned a random number and the user is given a random number.

The user must click the crystals until their total matches the total they have been assigned. If they match, they win. If not they lose.

This game was created with JQuery and the front end with HTML and CSS / Bootstrap 4 styling sheets.
